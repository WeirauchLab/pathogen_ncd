        There are many well-established relationships between pathogens and
        human disease, but far fewer when focusing on non-communicable diseases
        (NCDs). We leverage data from The UK Biobank and TriNetX to perform a
        systematic survey across 20 pathogens and 426 diseases, primarily NCDs.
        To this end, we assess the association between disease status and
        infection history proxies. We identify 206 pathogen-disease pairs that
        replicate in both cohorts. We replicate many established relationships,
        including <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> with several gastroenterological
        diseases and connections between Epstein-Barr virus with multiple
        sclerosis and lupus. Overall, our approach identified evidence of
        association for 15 pathogens and 96 distinct diseases, including a
        currently controversial link between human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and
        ulcerative colitis (UC). We validate this connection through two
        orthogonal analyses, revealing increased CMV gene expression in UC
        patients and enrichment for UC genetic risk signal near human genes that
        have altered expression upon CMV infection. Collectively, these results
        form a foundation for future investigations into mechanistic roles
        played by pathogens in NCDs. All results are easily accessible right
        here.

There are many well-established relationships between pathogens and human
disease, but far fewer when focusing on non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We
leverage data from The UK Biobank and TriNetX to perform a systematic survey
across 20 pathogens and 426 diseases, focused primarily on NCDs. To this end,
we assess association between disease status and infection history proxies. We
identify 206 pathogen-disease pairs that replicated in both cohorts. We
replicated established relationships to validate our method, including
Helicobacter pylori with several gastroenterological diseases, and connections
between Epstein-Barr virus with multiple sclerosis and lupus. Our approach
identified evidence of association for 15 of the pathogens and 96 distinct
diseases, including a strong link between human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and
ulcerative colitis (UC). We validate this connection through two orthogonal
analyses, revealing increased CMV gene expression in UC patients and enrichment
for UC genetic risk signal near human genes that have altered expression upon
CMV infection. Collectively, these results form a foundation for future
investigations into mechanistic roles played by pathogens in disease.
